# K8400-extboard
Alternative extension board for Velleman Vertex K8400 3D printer

After a few years of good work of my 3D printer, it failed.
Instead of a quick fix, I decided for an upgrade.
I wanted to mount a double E3DV6 hotend.
For the mechanical parts I took inspiration from this project.

but I did not liked the original extension board. I was worried about the current load on heat cartridges. 
And wanted a more reliable connection and easier mouting-unmounting options.

So this project design a new board with better connections that fits in a new mechanical design that I will link as soon as it is complete.
